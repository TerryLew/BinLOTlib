      "iPython Notebook is a tool that lets us work with code in a cell format. This is great because cells of code are much easier to tweak and play with; it feels you're working in a text editor, but also using the python console at the same time (with autocomplete!). You can also mix code with easy-to-read text like this.\n",

      "    - **ctrl + enter** lets us execute the code in the current cell, at any time\n",
      "- in *command mode*, we use the **arrow keys** to navigate between cells\n",
